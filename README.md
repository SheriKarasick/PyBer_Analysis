# PyBer_Analysis

## Context
PyBer is a ride-share company that has requested support in analyzing what it looks like to be a driver in one of their three different locale types and how this distinguishing factors influence their operations.  PyBer officials have noted that they can put their drivers into three functional buckets: Urban, Suburban, or Rural.  They came to V-Isuliaze to understand: "How do these three different areas of work influence the experience that operators have as facilitators of the PyBer experience? How do we support our operators in ensuring that we provide them an experience that will keep them providing a robust network of operators in all of our areas/regions of operation?"  

These questions will not be addressed in full by this particular analysis, but the data presented will open the door to asking additional questions that will help PyBer corporate the data required to ask the right questions and review the data through the lens of those quesitons.

## Analysis

In this analysis, two key images are critial to providing the context clues that will allow this level of analysis: 

The first image is a data dashboard, that while narrow in scope is rich in content for company leaders to understand the critical difference between operators in each of their three region types.
